# Orbit renderer (vite.config.ts roots at app/src/renderer), whose bare imports
# -- marked, dompurify -- are declared in the ROOT package.json. Node resolves
# them by walking up from app/src/renderer/ to /app/node_modules, which never
# reaches web/node_modules, so without this the vite build can't resolve them.

# web/shared/ at runtime, not the /app/shared this image ships, so the server
# died on module load. Bundling inlines every relative import (shared/, auth,
# rpc-guard, llm-key-routing) and leaves bare package imports external for the
# runner's npm ci to supply. Typechecking stays in CI, which has the app deps
# this stage doesn't install.
