/**
 * Loom <-> Galaxy-flavored-markdown content adapter. notebook.md is canonical.
 *
 * Push replaces each `loom-invocation` fenced block with a hidden carrier holding
 * the literal block, base64-encoded. The carrier is a CommonMark link-reference
 * definition (`[loom-invocation:v1]: #loom "<base64>"`): it renders to nothing and
 * is preserved byte-for-byte on store, so pull restores the original fences exactly.
 * (HTML comments do NOT work here -- Galaxy's page renderer escapes them to visible
 * text rather than hiding them, verified live against 26.1.rc1. A reference
 * definition is pure markdown, so it stays invisible.) base64 keeps the payload free
 * of quotes and newlines, so the carrier is always one well-formed line.
 *
 * Phase 2 adds a visible ` ```galaxy ` directive alongside the carrier; pull
 * strips the directives Loom emitted (Loom owns the projection under the
 * loom-canonical model and regenerates them each push). A Loom directive always
 * sits immediately above a carrier with no blank line between, so pull strips
 * only ```galaxy blocks in that position -- a ```galaxy fence a human wrote (or
 * a co-author added on the Galaxy side) survives the round trip.
