/**
 * Evidence gate for plan-step completion.
 *
 * Loom's system prompt says "Evidence comes before assertion -- you must run an
 * actual verification step before marking a notebook step complete", and
 * `docs/agent/galaxy-routing.md` is sharper still: "Treat invocation YAML
 * status as Galaxy job state. Treat the plan checkbox as verified-result
 * state." Nothing checked either one. Loom hard-gates what can hurt you
 * (exec-guard, write-jail, destructive deletes) and asked nicely for the thing
 * the product is actually for.
 *
 * ## Deny on contradiction, warn on absence
 *
 * The tempting design -- "block a checkbox flip that arrives without evidence"
 * -- is wrong here, and the codebase says so. `/execute` teaches
 * *evidence-first*: step 5 "Write the verification evidence into the notebook
 * before changing status", step 6 "Only after verification succeeds, edit the
 * markdown checkbox". So a flip-only edit is the **documented honest shape**,
 * and a gate keyed on "this edit added nothing" would fire on exactly the
 * behaviour Loom teaches. Absence of evidence is not decidable from one write:
 * Galaxy evidence lands in a `loom-invocation` block at end of file, prose
 * evidence may sit in a results section, and the honest sequence spans two
 * edits.
 *
 * What *is* decidable is **contradiction** -- two claims in the same file that
 * disagree, where one of them is machine-owned. When a plan step flips to
 * `- [x]` while the `loom-invocation` block bound to that step still reads
 * `in_progress` or `failed`, the agent is claiming a verified result for a run
 * Galaxy says has not succeeded. That status is written by the poller
 * (`galaxy-poller.ts` / `checkInvocations`), not by the model, so the check
 * cannot be satisfied by writing a convincing sentence -- which is the failure
 * mode that makes an evidence gate theater.
 *
 * Everything else is recorded, not blocked. A flip with no invocation binding
 * (a local step, say) gets no opinion at all: guessing there produces the false
 * positives that get gates switched off.
 *
 * ## Modes
 *
 * Default is `warn`: allow, record to `activity.jsonl`, so the real-world rate
 * can be measured before anyone makes this a hard failure. `deny` exists but is
 * **not validated** and must not become the default until that data exists --
 * adversarial review found one residual case where a deny would be
 * unactionable: an invocation can be pinned at `in_progress` forever, because
 * the `completed` transition requires `summary.ok > 0` and the poller
 * early-returns when Galaxy credentials disappear mid-session. There is no
 * agent action that clears that, and a gate whose remediation cannot be
 * executed is the gate people switch off.
 *
 * ## The exception is the user's, not the model's
 *
 * The first cut of this gate kept a `denied` set and let the second attempt on
 * a step through, reasoning that an unwinnable retry loop is worse than an
 * unevidenced claim. That is true of a loop and false of this: it made the
 * decision advisory, since a model that disagrees only has to ask twice. So the
 * deny now persists for as long as the contradiction does, and the escape hatch
 * is `/override <step-key> <reason>` (`evidence-override-command.ts`) -- a
 * person, a named step, a recorded reason, one write. A contradiction that
 * recurs on the same step is denied again.
 *
 * ## Known gaps, recorded rather than papered over
 *
 * All of these share one root: step identity and the poller's status both live
 * in text the model is allowed to rewrite. They close together, when the
 * poller's verdict is held out of band in a record the model cannot author --
 * the approval/attempt registry, not here. Each has a test pinning current
 * behaviour so it stays visible rather than forgotten.
 *
 * 1. **The two-edit split.** Rewrite `status:` in one edit, flip the checkbox
 *    in the next. The pre-image of the second edit already says `completed`.
 * 2. **Anchor rename plus flip, in one edit.** The post-image step key is no
 *    longer the pre-image's, so it does not read as a flip at all.
 * 3. **Plan-heading rename plus flip, in one edit.** The step leaves the
 *    `## Plan X:` section and stops parsing as a plan step.
 * 4. **Anything that is not a file tool.** `WRITE_TOOLS` is `write` and `edit`;
 *    a `bash` heredoc or `sed -i` against `notebook.md` never reaches this
 *    hook. Same class as the `.loom/` bash hole tracked separately; the right
 *    home for it is the exec-guard's write policy, not a second gate here.
 * 5. **`activity.jsonl` is writable by the model.** The audit trail this gate
 *    appends to is an ordinary file in the workspace, so a sufficiently
 *    motivated model can forge an `evidence.override` row or rewrite a past
 *    decision. Also an exec-guard deny-floor question rather than one this
 *    module can answer, and the reason the durable record has to be the
 *    registry rather than the sidecar.

 * Three properties this depends on, all verified against the code rather than

 *
 * 1. **Read the PRE-image, never the post-image.** The block is ordinary
 *    plaintext in the same file, so an edit that flips the checkbox *and*
 *    rewrites `status: in_progress` to `completed` in one hunk would clear a
 *    post-image check by construction -- the sole deny path defeating itself in
 *    one call. The pre-image is what Galaxy's poller last wrote, before the
 *    edit under adjudication. (A two-edit split -- rewrite status, then flip --
 *    still evades this; see the module note on the out-of-band record.)
 *
 * 2. **`in_progress` only, never `failed`.** `failed` is a rolled-up
 *    any-job-errored verdict, it is sticky, and `checkInvocations` polls only
 *    `in_progress` blocks (`tools.ts:650`) so it can never be re-polled back
 *    out. Denying on it would block the legitimate flip after a successful
 *    rerun, with no remediation the agent could actually execute.
 *
 * 3. **Anchors are not unique.** `upsertInvocationBlock` keys on
 *    `invocation_id` (`notebook-writer.ts:283`), so a rerun leaves a second
 *    block with the same `notebook_anchor`. If ANY block for the anchor reads
 *    `completed`, the step is not contradicted -- the common retry shape is a
 *    stale `failed`/`in_progress` block beside the fresh `completed` one, and
 *    failing open there is the difference between a gate people keep and a
