/**
 * Background poller for active Galaxy workflow invocations.
 *
 * Part 2 of #67. Part 1 added the YAML counters + the Activity-tab UI
 * section that draws progress bars from them. This file is the timer
 * that keeps those counters fresh between agent turns: every
 * POLL_INTERVAL_MS, scan the notebook for in-flight blocks; if any
 * exist, run `checkInvocations` to advance status and write updated
 * counters back to notebook.md.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   - session_start → startGalaxyPoller(): unconditionally start the
 *     timer. Each tick is cheap when no blocks are in-flight (one
 *     notebook read + scan, no Galaxy call).
 *   - session_shutdown → stopGalaxyPoller(): clear timer.
 *   - Multiple session_start (brain restart) → start() stops any prior
 *     timer first; idempotent.
 *
 * Why "always running" instead of stopping on idle:
 *   If we stopped at "no in-flight blocks", the next time the agent
 *   recorded a new invocation mid-session we'd never wake up — only
 *   another session_start would. Avoids a circular import between
 *   tools.ts (which records invocations) and this file. The cost is
 *   one notebook read + scan per 15s, which is negligible.
 *
 * Concurrency: ticks are guarded by `inFlight` so a slow Galaxy GET
 * doesn't stack ticks. The check itself uses the existing per-notebook
 * lock in withNotebookLock, so a manual `galaxy_invocation_check_all`
 * call from the agent doesn't race the poller.
