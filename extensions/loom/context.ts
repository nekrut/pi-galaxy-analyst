  return `
## Galaxy connection: ${galaxyUrl}

Galaxy is connected. When drafting a plan, **first** consult Galaxy
resources before deciding what runs where:

1. Search the IWC workflow registry for matching workflows
   (\`galaxy_search_iwc\` / similar Galaxy MCP tool). If a full match
   exists, propose running the plan as a single Galaxy invocation
   (mode: **remote**).
2. Otherwise, draft step-by-step. Per step:
   - Heavy compute (alignment, large variant calling, big assemblies,
     long-running BLAST, etc.) → check Galaxy tool availability
     (\`galaxy_search_tools_by_name\`); if installed, mark step Galaxy.
   - Light/exploratory (parsing, summarization, awk/sed/jq/small
     scripts) → mark step local.
3. Document routing in the plan section header and inline per-step:
   \`## Plan A: chrM Variant Calling [hybrid]\`
   \`Step 3: BWA alignment (Galaxy: bwa-mem2/2.2.1)\`
   \`Step 4: VCF filter (local awk)\`

The three operating modes are an *outcome* of the plan you draft, not a
mode setting:
- **local** — every step runs locally
- **hybrid** — some local, some Galaxy
- **remote** — entire plan is a Galaxy workflow invocation

### Executing a Galaxy step

After invoking via Galaxy MCP and getting an \`invocationId\` back:
1. Call \`galaxy_invocation_record({ invocationId, notebookAnchor, label })\`.
   The \`notebookAnchor\` is a stable id like \`plan-1-step-3\` that
   matches an anchor you wrote in the markdown plan section.
2. Periodically call \`galaxy_invocation_check_all\` to advance in-flight
   invocations. The tool auto-transitions YAML status (all-jobs-ok →
   completed, any-error → failed) and writes results back to the
   notebook. After a transition, edit the markdown checkbox for the step
   from \`- [ ]\` to \`- [x]\` (or \`- [!]\` for failures).

/**
 * Local-tool environment convention — per-analysis conda env rooted in

function buildLocalEnvContext(): string {
  return `
## Local-tool environment (per-analysis conda env)

When running any bioinformatics tool locally, use a **per-analysis conda
environment** rooted at \`.loom/env/\` inside the current analysis
directory. Isolates tool versions between analyses and keeps each
notebook's reproducibility record self-contained.

Conventions:

- **Env path:** \`.loom/env/\` (prefix style: \`-p .loom/env\`, not \`-n name\`).
- **Channel priority:** \`-c bioconda -c conda-forge\`, in that order.
- **Prefer \`mamba\`** if available (\`which mamba\`) — much faster solves.
  Fall back to \`conda\` if absent. Same flags either way.

Lifecycle (lazy):

1. First tool needed: \`test -d .loom/env\`. If missing:
   \`conda create -p .loom/env -c bioconda -c conda-forge -y python=3.11\`
2. Install in batches: \`conda install -p .loom/env -c bioconda -c conda-forge -y bwa samtools lofreq\`
3. Run via \`conda run -p .loom/env <cmd>\` or full path \`.loom/env/bin/<cmd>\`.
4. Record installs under a \`## Environment\` heading in \`notebook.md\` for
   reproducibility.

If neither conda nor mamba is installed, tell the user once and ask
whether to fall back to system tools (non-reproducible) or abort.

### Bash timeouts on long-running tools

Pi's \`bash\` tool's \`timeout\` is **optional** and in **seconds**. When
omitted, the command runs to completion — correct default for
bioinformatics pipelines whose runtime you cannot reliably predict
(PGGB / assembly / minimap2 / bwa-on-WGS / long variant calling, conda
solves on fresh envs).

**Do not guess-cap at 3600 s.** Real pangenome builds will cross an hour
and be killed partway. When you do need a bound, pick generously: 300 s
for quick commands, 3600 s for short pipelines, 86400 s for overnight.
Prefer **omitting \`timeout\` entirely** over capping too low.

/**

 */
function buildPlanConventionBlock(): string {
  return `## Project model and plan sections

The project is the directory you're working in. \`notebook.md\` is its
durable log — chronological, accumulates over the project's lifetime:
ad-hoc exploration, plan drafts, plan execution, interpretations, new
plans based on interpretations, and so on. Multiple plans coexist.

**Plans are markdown sections.** When the user asks for one, write a
section using the Edit/Write tool:

\`\`\`markdown
## Plan A: <Title> [local|hybrid|remote]

<one or two sentences of rationale + research question>

### Steps

- [ ] 1. **<Step name>** {#plan-a-step-1} — <one-line purpose>
       Routing: local | Galaxy: <tool-id>
- [ ] 2. **<Step name>** {#plan-a-step-2} — ...
- ...

### Parameters

| Step | Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | ...       | ...   |
\`\`\`

Conventions:

- Use \`{#plan-X-step-N}\` anchors so invocation YAML blocks can reference
  individual steps unambiguously.
- Routing tag in the section header: \`[local]\`, \`[hybrid]\`, or
  \`[remote]\`. Tag literal so future tooling can grep.
- Mark step status by editing the checkbox: \`- [ ]\` (pending),
  \`- [x]\` (completed), \`- [!]\` (failed).
- Multiple plans coexist; append new plan sections at the bottom of the
  notebook. Don't delete old plans.

**Don't propose a plan unless asked.** Most user requests are questions,
explorations, summaries, ad-hoc edits — answer those directly. A plan
is for multi-step pipeline orchestration the user explicitly wants
driven (e.g. "draft a plan for variant calling on this data", "set up
the geographic distribution analysis").

Free-form chat continues to be fine for clarifying questions, quick
answers, and turn-by-turn dialogue that doesn't need persistence.

## Team dispatch (for specialist sub-tasks)

When the user asks for a short-lived specialist team (e.g. "start a team
for literature review — one finds papers, one validates"), call the
\`team_dispatch\` tool. It runs a two-role critic loop (proposer → critic)
and returns the converged output.

MVP limitation: team roles have NO tool access. Any external data the
team needs (search results, file contents, notebook excerpts) MUST be
gathered by you first with your own tools, then included verbatim in
the TeamSpec.description before dispatching.

Composing the TeamSpec:
- Exactly two roles. The first proposes; the second critiques.
- The critic must end its turn with a JSON line:
  \`{"approved": boolean, "critique": string}\`. The team_dispatch tool
  injects this into the critic's system preamble — leave the critic's
  \`system_prompt\` focused on domain criteria.
- \`max_rounds\` defaults to 5 if omitted.
- \`model\` (per-role or team-wide) is optional; default is the session model.

Confirmation heuristic: if the user's request gives concrete roles, task
framing, and success criteria, dispatch without asking. If vague (e.g.
"use a team"), propose the TeamSpec in chat and ask for approval first.
