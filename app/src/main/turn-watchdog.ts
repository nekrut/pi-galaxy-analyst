/**
 * Watchdog that breaks the "stuck on thinking" hang (#185).
 *
 * Orbit clears its "...thinking" indicator only when the brain emits a terminal
 * event (`agent_end` / `error` / `message_end` with an error stop reason). When a
 * cloud provider call fails or stalls *after* prompt preflight, pi can emit no
 * terminal event at all -- the RPC layer swallows a post-preflight throw, and a
 * truly stalled socket never resolves -- so the UI spins forever with no error,
 * no timeout, no recovery.
 *
 * This watchdog is the shell-side backstop: while a prompt is in flight it arms a
 * silence timer, resets it on every byte of brain activity, and fires if the
 * brain goes completely silent for `timeoutMs`. It deliberately pauses for the
 * whole tool-execution window and while a UI modal is open, since those are
 * legitimate long/indefinite waits rather than a stalled provider call.
