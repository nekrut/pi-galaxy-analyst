# Loom

An AI research harness for [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org) bioinformatics, built on [Pi.dev](https://pi.dev).

Loom weaves the threads of a research project -- question, data, analysis, interpretation, publication -- into a durable, resumable notebook. It creates plans, runs Galaxy tools, documents every decision, and keeps the whole record reproducible.

This repo hosts both the brain and a reference shell:

- **Loom** is the *brain* -- the Pi.dev agent runtime in [`extensions/galaxy-analyst/`](extensions/galaxy-analyst/) plus the RPC contract it exposes. Plan state, notebook persistence, Galaxy integration, the five-phase lifecycle, provenance.
- **`gxypi`** is the terminal CLI consumer. First-class and the primary validation path. Installed from npm; reads brain-level config from `~/.loom/config.json`.
- **Orbit** (in [`app/`](app/)) is the Electron desktop shell -- chat + dual-pane artifact layout with a Galaxy-themed step graph. Orbit is optional; the `gxypi` CLI is a supported standalone path.

Future shells -- a Galaxy-embedded web UI, a hosted server mode, anything else -- can talk to the same brain over RPC.

The repo is still named `pi-galaxy-analyst`; a rename is a follow-up. Loom is the product identity.

## How it works

1. You open Orbit (or run `gxypi`) in an analysis directory and describe what you want to do.
2. The agent builds a formal plan -- research question, phased steps, dependencies -- and stores it in a markdown notebook committed to git on every change.
3. Each step runs as a Galaxy user-defined tool (default) or a local command, with the agent logging decisions and QC checkpoints as it goes.
4. In Orbit, the artifact pane auto-reveals the Plan tab, the Steps tab renders a React Flow DAG, and the Notebook tab shows the live markdown record. In `gxypi`, the same state is viewable via slash commands.
5. Come back the next day -- opening the same directory resumes the plan from the notebook, in either consumer.

## Current state

Implemented and locally tested; live Galaxy end-to-end validation is still in progress.

- TypeScript typecheck passes against `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` `0.55.0`
- Local automated suite: 122 tests passing
- Notebook persistence, plan state, workflow metadata, BRC context, and extension registration are covered by tests
- Provenance notebook sync has a dedicated regression check via `npm run validate:provenance`
- Runtime validation has confirmed extension loading, Galaxy connection/history state bridging, and notebook rewriting for `data_set_source`
- Remaining validation: stronger tool-calling model on the live MCP path, then Galaxy end-to-end with real histories, datasets, and jobs

### What Orbit ships today

- Dual-pane layout: streaming chat on the left, collapsible artifact pane on the right (auto-reveals on first plan, toggle with `Cmd/Ctrl+\`)
- Plan tab with rendered markdown + raw edit modes and a parameter form for reviewing step arguments
- Steps tab: React Flow + dagre DAG of the analysis plan with live status coloring
- Notebook tab: the live `notebook.md` rendered as markdown (refresh with `/notebook`) plus typed result blocks from `report_result`
- Chat: streaming, thinking indicator, tool cards, queue-while-streaming (`/btw`)
- Process monitor strip: live CPU / memory / runtime for every subprocess the agent spawns
- Cost / token header with pricing for Claude 4.5 & 4.6, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5, and local providers
- Local / Remote execution toggle in the masthead -- Remote registers the Galaxy MCP server, Local strips it entirely
- Preferences dialog (`Cmd/Ctrl+,`): provider / model / API key, Galaxy credentials, default working directory
- First-run welcome screen: one-page setup for LLM key, optional Galaxy profile, working directory
- Galaxy brand dark theme with Inter + JetBrains Mono fonts bundled locally
- Session continuity: `--continue` on restart (model switch, preference save, Local/Remote toggle) preserves chat history; `/new` starts a clean slate; first launch in a directory with an existing Pi session auto-resumes

### What gxypi ships today

Everything brain-side works through the CLI. The display is a terminal UI instead of a React artifact pane; structured widget events collapse down to text summaries. Slash commands (`/plan`, `/status`, `/notebook`, `/plan-decisions`, `/connect`, `/profiles`) behave the same. You can use `gxypi` without ever launching Orbit.

## Install

### Quick path -- CLI only

```bash
npm install -g gxypi
```

Or run without installing:

```bash
npx gxypi
```

You'll also need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for the Galaxy MCP server (invoked automatically via `uvx`):

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Full install -- CLI + Orbit

Clone the repo and install both workspaces:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/galaxyproject/pi-galaxy-analyst.git
cd pi-galaxy-analyst
npm install
cd app && npm install
```

Launch Orbit:

```bash
npm start                              # from app/
```

Or use the CLI:

```bash
node bin/gxypi.js                      # from repo root
```

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git curl build-essential

# Node.js via nvm (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install --lts

# uv (for galaxy-mcp)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Then the "Full install" steps above.

#### macOS

```bash
# Homebrew, if not already installed
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

brew install node git uv
```

Then the "Full install" steps above.

#### Windows (WSL2)

Orbit runs on Windows inside WSL2. From an elevated PowerShell:

```powershell
wsl --install --web-download -d Ubuntu
```

Reboot, set up your Ubuntu user, then inside the Ubuntu terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/galaxyproject/pi-galaxy-analyst/main/scripts/setup-wsl.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc

cd ~/pi-galaxy-analyst/app && npm start
```

Keep your analysis data inside `~/` (the Linux filesystem) -- `/mnt/c/` paths are significantly slower across the filesystem boundary.

### After installation

In Orbit, on first launch, the welcome screen asks for an LLM provider + key and (optionally) a Galaxy server. You need at least one of: [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/), [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/), or [Google AI](https://aistudio.google.com/). Local providers like [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and LiteLLM work too.

In `gxypi`, the equivalent is editing `~/.loom/config.json` (see [Configuration](#configuration)) or running `gxypi --provider anthropic` and following the OAuth prompts.

## Usage

### CLI (`gxypi`)

```bash
gxypi
```

```
You: I have RNA-seq data from a drug treatment experiment -- 6 samples,
     3 treated and 3 control HeLa cells. I want to find differentially
     expressed genes. The data is at GEO accession GSE164073.

Pi:  I'll help you set up a structured analysis. Let me start by refining
     the research question.

     Research Question: "Does drug X treatment alter gene expression
     in HeLa cells, specifically in inflammatory response pathways?"

     I've created an analysis plan and saved it to:
     📓 rna-seq-drug-treatment-notebook.md

     The plan has 5 steps:
       1. ⬜ Quality Control (FastQC + MultiQC)
       2. ⬜ Read Trimming (Cutadapt)
       3. ⬜ Alignment (HISAT2 to hg38)
       4. ⬜ Quantification (featureCounts)
       5. ⬜ Differential Expression (DESeq2)

     Ready to start with QC?
```

Come back the next day to the same directory and everything resumes:

```
$ gxypi

Pi:  Loaded notebook: RNA-seq Drug Treatment (1/5 steps completed)

     Last session completed Quality Control (passed).
     Next step: Read Trimming with Cutadapt.

     Ready to continue?
```

You can also load just the extension into Pi directly:

```bash
pi --no-extensions -e ./extensions/galaxy-analyst
```

If you're debugging the terminal path, prefer these commands before using Orbit.

### Orbit (Electron shell)

```bash
cd app && npm start
```

The artifact pane starts collapsed; as soon as the agent creates a plan, it auto-reveals on the Plan tab. The Steps tab shows the React Flow DAG. The Notebook tab renders the live markdown notebook (refresh with `/notebook`). Tab activity dots highlight updates since you last viewed each tab.

Keyboard shortcuts:
- `Cmd/Ctrl+\` -- collapse / expand the artifact pane
- `Cmd/Ctrl+,` -- open Preferences
- `Cmd/Ctrl+O` -- switch working directory (does not restart the session; notifies the agent instead)
- `Esc` -- dismiss modal prompts

## Configuration

Loom uses a single brain-level config at `~/.loom/config.json`. Every consumer (the `gxypi` CLI, Orbit, any future shell) reads and writes it:

```json
{
  "llm": {
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "apiKey": "sk-ant-...",
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"
  },
  "galaxy": {
    "active": "usegalaxy-org",
    "profiles": {
      "usegalaxy-org": {
        "url": "https://usegalaxy.org",
        "apiKey": "abc123"
      }
    }
  },
  "executionMode": "remote",
  "defaultCwd": "~/analyses"
}
```

All sections are optional. If `llm` is missing, consumers fall back to environment variables or OAuth login. If `galaxy` is missing, use `/connect` to add a server interactively -- credentials save to the config automatically. `executionMode` is `"remote"` by default (registers Galaxy MCP, Galaxy UDTs are the primary execution path); `"local"` strips Galaxy MCP for exploratory work.

Orbit-specific state (window geometry, pane preferences) lives in `~/.orbit/` so multiple shells can coexist without stepping on each other.

Environment variable overrides:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
export GALAXY_URL="https://usegalaxy.org"
export GALAXY_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

If you have an existing setup with `~/.gxypi/config.json` (from earlier CLI versions) or with `~/.pi/agent/galaxy-profiles.json` / `~/.pi/agent/models.json`, the CLI migrates them into `~/.loom/config.json` on first run. The old files stay in place; nothing is deleted.

### Local LLMs

Pi supports any OpenAI-compatible API. For [LiteLLM](https://litellm.ai/), [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), or other local backends:

```json
{
  "llm": {
    "provider": "litellm",
    "apiKey": "your-key",
    "model": "your-model-name"
  }
}
```

You'll also need `~/.pi/agent/models.json` for model capability metadata (context window, token limits) -- see Pi's documentation. The Loom config handles provider selection and API keys; `models.json` handles model metadata Pi needs for request sizing.

Or pass flags directly: `gxypi --provider litellm --model your-model-name`.

## Commands

### Slash commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/plan` | Show the current analysis plan |
| `/plan-decisions` | Show the decision log |
| `/notebook` | Show the live notebook content (or list notebooks in cwd) |
| `/status` | Galaxy connection + plan progress summary |
| `/connect [name]` | Connect to Galaxy (prompts for credentials, or switches profile) |
| `/profiles` | List saved Galaxy server profiles |
| `/new` | Start a fresh session (Orbit only) |

In Orbit, plan-related slash commands are active in the plan editor: `/review`, `/test`, `/execute`, `/run`.

## Five-phase lifecycle

Loom guides analyses through five phases. You can move between them freely -- the phases shape the agent's defaults without locking you in.

1. **Problem Definition** -- refine the research question (PICO framework), add literature references.
2. **Data Acquisition** -- track data sources (GEO, SRA, local), register samples, generate samplesheets, link to Galaxy datasets.
3. **Analysis** -- create a step-by-step plan, execute tools / workflows via Galaxy, log every decision, record QC checkpoints with pass/fail criteria.
4. **Interpretation** -- review results in biological context, run pathway analysis.
5. **Publication** -- generate methods sections from the tool versions actually used, track figures, prepare data sharing.

Everything persists to a **notebook file** -- a readable markdown document with YAML blocks for structured data. Open it in any editor, share it with collaborators, or use it to reproduce the analysis later.

### Git-tracked notebooks

When Loom creates a notebook it initializes a git repo in the working directory (if one doesn't already exist) and commits every meaningful change as it happens. Step completions, QC checkpoints, decisions, phase transitions -- each gets its own commit with a descriptive message like `Add step: Read Mapping` or `QC: Post-alignment QC (passed)`.

This gives you:

- **Full undo history.** `git log` shows exactly what changed and when. Diff any two points; revert a bad step.
- **Reproducibility evidence.** The commit history is a timestamped, immutable record of every decision and result.
- **Branch-based exploration.** Try an alternative DE threshold or a different aligner on a branch, compare notebooks side by side with `git diff`.
- **Collaboration.** Push the repo to GitHub and collaborators can pull, review the analysis history, and continue.

The auto-created `.gitignore` excludes large bioinformatics files (FASTQ, BAM, VCF, etc.) so only the notebook markdown and small artifacts get tracked. Granular changes like Galaxy dataset references and literature additions bundle into the next structural commit rather than creating their own, keeping the history clean.

## Terminal-only validation

For non-Electron validation:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run validate:provenance
pi --no-extensions -e ./extensions/galaxy-analyst
```

Then validate the wrapper in a plain working directory:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/gxypi-cli-validation
cd /tmp/gxypi-cli-validation
node /path/to/pi-galaxy-analyst/bin/gxypi.js --provider litellm --model gpt-oss-120b
```
