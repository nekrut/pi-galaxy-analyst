# Loom & Orbit

An AI research harness for [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org) bioinformatics, built on [Pi.dev](https://pi.dev).

Loom turns a working directory into a co-scientist project: ad-hoc exploration, plans, executed steps, interpretations, and follow-up plans all accumulate as markdown in a single, durable, git-tracked `notebook.md`. The agent reads and writes that notebook directly; there is no parallel structured-state store. When Galaxy is configured the agent surveys the workflow registry and tool catalog while drafting plans and routes individual steps to Galaxy or local execution as appropriate.

**Loom** is the agent brain — the Pi.dev runtime in [`extensions/loom/`](extensions/loom/), the system-prompt context, Galaxy invocation tracking, the skills system, and the RPC contract. Run it directly from the terminal with `loom` (`npm install -g @galaxyproject/loom`) or through **Orbit** (in [`app/`](app/)), the Electron desktop shell with a chat + tabbed-artifact layout.

The names trace real cosmology. The universe's large-scale structure is the _cosmic web_ -- galaxies strung along filaments of dark matter, woven into sheets and voids. Loom weaves your research record the way the cosmic web weaves galaxies; Orbit is the electron shell you observe it from.

Future shells — a Galaxy-embedded web UI, a hosted server mode, anything else — talk to the same brain over RPC.

That web shell already has a working seed today: a browser-served build of the Orbit renderer, running the same brain over RPC, reachable from another device on your LAN -- handy for chatting from a phone, and a natural home for Galaxy interactive tools later on. It's an unauthenticated single-user dev tool for now, so keep it on a trusted network; setup and the security caveats are in [`web/README.md`](web/README.md).

## How it works

1. You open Orbit (or run `loom`) in an analysis directory. A `notebook.md` is created on first launch and committed to git.
2. You chat with the agent: ask questions, drop file paths, request data lookups. None of this requires a "plan" — the conversation is just a conversation.
3. When you ask for a plan, the agent drafts it **in chat** as a markdown section, then waits for you to approve. Once you approve, it asks you to review parameters; once you approve those too, it writes the plan section into `notebook.md` and starts executing.
4. If Galaxy is connected, the agent considers per-step routing during drafting (does an IWC workflow match? does Galaxy have the heavy tool installed?) and tags each step `[local]`, `[hybrid]`, or `[remote]` in the markdown.
5. While a Galaxy step runs, a `loom-invocation` YAML block in the notebook tracks the invocation. The polling tool reads those blocks, queries Galaxy, and updates them in place when jobs finish or fail.
6. Multiple plans coexist in the notebook. After interpreting one analysis, ask for another — the new plan section appends below the previous one.
7. Come back the next day, open the same directory, the notebook is the project. Sessions resume automatically.

## Architecture

```

The notebook is the durable state. Plans, decisions, results, and interpretation all live as markdown sections inside `notebook.md` — the agent maintains them via the standard `Edit`/`Write` tools. The only structured side-records are `loom-invocation` YAML blocks for in-flight Galaxy work.

## Current state

Implemented and locally tested.

- TypeScript typecheck passes (root + Orbit).
- Local automated suite: 261 tests passing (notebook I/O, invocation YAML round-trip, profile / credential handling, team-dispatch, session-index, Galaxy config).
- Notebook is the source of truth -- there is no parallel plan struct to drift from it.
- Galaxy invocation polling is exercised against the deterministic state-transition rules (`all-ok → completed`, `any-error → failed`).
- Skills system fetches on demand from `galaxyproject/galaxy-skills` (shipped as default). Additional skill repos are restricted to `github.com/galaxyproject/*` (skill content is treated as authoritative agent instructions, so an arbitrary third-party repo would be a prompt-injection vector).
- Galaxy API keys are encrypted at rest in Orbit via Electron `safeStorage`; the brain receives the decrypted key as an env var at spawn time. CLI users without `safeStorage` fall back to plaintext on disk.
- End-to-end validation against a live Galaxy server is in progress.

### What Orbit ships today

- **Three-pane layout**: file tree on the left, chat in the center, tabbed artifact pane on the right (Notebook, Activity, File).
- **Notebook tab**: live `notebook.md` rendered as markdown with auto-refresh on file changes. Project log accumulates over time.
- **Activity tab**: split horizontally — agent shell stream on top (live tool calls, status, stdout from `run_command`), proc-monitor on the bottom (live CPU / memory / runtime for every subprocess the agent spawns).
- **File tab**: appears when you open a file from the left tree, dismissable via `×`. Previews text (Markdown, code, JSON/YAML, FASTA / FASTQ / VCF / BED / GFF / GTF / SAM / Newick / etc.), images, and PDFs.
- **Chat**: streaming responses with thinking indicator; markdown-rendered with proper tables; `team_dispatch` rich card; queue-while-streaming; numbered prompt turns (`/summarize 3 5` works against those numbers).
- **Slash-command popup** appears as you type `/`. Tab to autocomplete; Enter still submits past it; Esc dismisses.
- **Prompt history**: ↑ / ↓ in the input recalls previously-submitted prompts (per-cwd, persistent).
- **Galaxy connection indicator** in the footer (RED dot if no API key, GREEN dot if connected). Click to open Preferences.
- **Cost / token header**: live in-flight cost (computed from Pi-reported `usage.cost`) and token totals.
- **Preferences dialog** (`Cmd/Ctrl+,`): provider / model / API key, Galaxy credentials, default working directory, package manager, and a configurable list of **skill repositories** (galaxy-skills shipped as default).
- **First-run welcome screen**: one-page setup. Skippable — you can configure later from Preferences.
- **Responsive layout**: at narrow widths the file tree (<900 px) and artifact pane (<700 px) auto-collapse so the chat stays usable. Toolbar buttons re-expand them.
- **Keyboard accessibility**: `Cmd/Ctrl+\` toggles the artifact pane; `Cmd/Ctrl+B` toggles the file tree; `Cmd/Ctrl+,` opens Preferences; `Cmd/Ctrl+O` switches working directory; `Esc` dismisses modals; gold focus-ring on every Tab-reachable control.
- **Galaxy brand dark theme** with Inter (body) + JetBrains Mono (code) bundled locally.
- **Session continuity**: `--continue` on restart preserves chat history; `/new` starts a clean slate; first launch in a directory with an existing Pi session auto-resumes.

### What the Loom CLI ships today

Everything brain-side works through the CLI. The display is a terminal UI instead of a tabbed artifact pane; structured widget events collapse down to text summaries. Slash commands behave the same. You can use `loom` without ever launching Orbit.

## Project model

A "project" is a working directory. `notebook.md` in that directory is the chronological project log: ad-hoc exploration notes, plan sections, executed steps, interpretations, new plans, and so on. Multiple plans coexist over a project's lifetime.

Plans are markdown sections like:

```markdown
## Plan A: chrM Variant Calling [hybrid]

Goal: identify variants in chrM across 4 paired-end samples, compare allele
frequencies across tissues.

### Steps

- [ ] 1. **QC FASTQ** {#plan-a-step-1} — fastp adapter trim + per-base QC
  - Routing: local
  - Tool: fastp
  - Verification: confirm fastp HTML/JSON report exists and includes per-base quality metrics
- [x] 2. **Reference index** {#plan-a-step-2} — bwa index of chrM
  - Routing: local
  - Tool: bwa index, samtools faidx
  - Verification: confirm BWA index sidecar files and `.fai` exist
- [ ] 3. **Read alignment** {#plan-a-step-3} — BWA-MEM, paired collection
  - Routing: Galaxy
  - Tool: bwa-mem2/2.2.1
  - Verification: poll Galaxy invocation to `ok` and inspect BAM outputs
- ...

### Parameters

| Step | Tool  | Parameter | Default | Value | Description          |
| ---- | ----- | --------- | ------- | ----- | -------------------- |
| 1    | fastp | min_qual  | 20      | 20    | minimum base quality |
```

Conventions:

- Routing tag in the section header: `[local]`, `[hybrid]`, or `[remote]`. Literal so future tooling can grep.
- Step status by the checkbox: `- [ ]` pending, `- [x]` verified completed, `- [!]` failed.
- If verification is blocked or inconclusive but the step itself has not failed, leave the step pending and record the blocker.
- Anchors `{#plan-X-step-N}` so Galaxy invocation YAML can reference individual steps.
- Multiple plans coexist; new plan sections append at the bottom. Old plans aren't deleted.

See [docs/agent/notebook-schema.md](docs/agent/notebook-schema.md) for
verification evidence requirements.

### Four-stage approval before notebook write

Plans don't land in the notebook on first draft. The agent is instructed to follow this order:

1. **Draft in chat** as a markdown plan section. Not in the notebook yet.
2. **Wait for plan approval** ("yes", "go", "looks good", etc.). If you ask for changes, the agent revises the draft in chat and asks again.
3. **Show the parameter table in chat**, accepting inline edits ("set min_qual to 30, leave others"). Default behavior is to show **all** parameters per tool, not a curated subset — you decide what's worth changing.
4. **Wait for parameter approval**.

Only after both gates pass should the agent write the plan section into `notebook.md` and start executing. This is prompt-level discipline, not a hard runtime lock; manual override: tell the agent "save this plan to the notebook even though I haven't approved it" if you really want to.

### Per-plan Galaxy routing

When Galaxy is connected, the agent surveys Galaxy resources before drafting:

- A full IWC workflow match → propose the plan as a single Galaxy invocation (mode: **remote**).
- Otherwise step-by-step: heavy compute (alignment, large variant calling, big assemblies) → Galaxy if the tool is available; light/exploratory (parsing, awk/sed/jq, small scripts) → local.

The three operating modes (**local** / **hybrid** / **remote**) are an _outcome_ of the plan, not a configuration setting.

### Galaxy invocation tracking

When an agent invokes a Galaxy workflow it embeds a fenced YAML block in the notebook:

```loom-invocation
invocation_id: abc123
galaxy_server_url: https://usegalaxy.org
notebook_anchor: plan-a-step-3
label: BWA alignment
submitted_at: 2026-04-25T15:30:00Z
status: in_progress
summary: ""
```

The polling tool `galaxy_invocation_check_all` scans the notebook for in-flight blocks, polls Galaxy for each, and applies deterministic state transitions (all-jobs-ok → `completed`, any-error → `failed`) by rewriting the YAML in place. No external state store; the notebook is authoritative.

### Git-tracked notebooks

When Loom starts in a directory that isn't already a git repo, it runs `git init`, drops a bioinformatics-friendly `.gitignore`, and marks the repo with `git config loom.managed true`. From then on every notebook write triggers an auto-commit, giving you:

- **Full undo history.** `git log` shows what changed and when.
- **Reproducibility evidence.** Timestamped, immutable record of every decision.
- **Branch-based exploration.** Try an alternative on a branch; compare with `git diff`.
- **Collaboration.** Push the repo to GitHub; collaborators pull, review, and continue.

If you start Loom in an **existing** git repo, auto-commit stays off by default -- Loom won't write commits into a project it didn't create. Opt in with:

```bash
git config loom.managed true
```

The auto-created `.gitignore` excludes large bioinformatics files (FASTQ, BAM, VCF, etc.) plus the per-session `activity.jsonl` and `session.jsonl` sidecars, so only the notebook markdown and small artifacts get tracked.

## Skills system

Loom can fetch operational know-how from curated GitHub repos following the Claude-Code skills convention (top-level `AGENTS.md` router + nested `SKILL.md` files). The agent calls `skills_fetch({ repo, path })` on demand.

**`galaxyproject/galaxy-skills` is shipped as the default** — when no skills are configured, Loom seeds it on first read. It covers:

- **Collection manipulation** (paired collections from PE FASTQ, mapping a tool over a collection, Apply Rules DSL, Galaxy Tools API patterns)
- **Galaxy MCP usage and gotchas**
- **Workflow report templates**
- **Nextflow → Galaxy conversion**
- **Galaxy tool development**
- **Updating ToolShed tool revisions**

Add your own repos in **Preferences → Skills**. Each entry is `{ name, url, branch?, enabled? }`. The URL allowlist is `https://github.com/galaxyproject/*` (the agent treats fetched SKILL.md content as authoritative instructions, so arbitrary repos are a prompt-injection vector). Example:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "repos": [
      {
        "name": "galaxy-skills",
        "url": "https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-skills",
        "enabled": true
      },
      {
        "name": "galaxy-genome-skills",
        "url": "https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-genome-skills",
        "branch": "main",
        "enabled": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Loosening the allowlist means editing `ALLOWED_SKILLS_PREFIX` in `shared/loom-config.js`. Plan: a per-repo signing / pinning model before opening this up.

Fetched files cache to `~/.loom/cache/skills/<repo-name>/<path>` with a 24-hour TTL -- covers offline use and reduces network round-trips on repeated reads.

## Install

Three paths, depending on what you want.

### Desktop app (Orbit)

Orbit ships as a native installer that bundles its own Node runtime, `uv`, and Loom -- no separate prerequisites. The macOS (Apple Silicon) build is Developer ID signed + notarized, so it opens with a normal double-click; Linux ships `.deb`/`.rpm`/`.zip`. Both are attached to each [release](https://github.com/galaxyproject/loom/releases). Windows runs via WSL2. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for per-platform steps and [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) for how a release is cut. Intel Macs and other unpackaged targets can use the developer install below.

### Loom CLI from npm

Run the brain on the command line without Orbit. Requires Node 22.19+ and (for Galaxy MCP) [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
npm install -g @galaxyproject/loom
loom
```

Or run without installing:

```bash
npx @galaxyproject/loom
```

**Pop into Orbit any time.** Once Orbit is installed, type `/orbit` inside
the Loom CLI to open the current analysis in the desktop app -- same analysis
directory, same notebook, just a richer view. Orbit opens on that directory;
close the CLI (Ctrl-D or `/exit`) once it's up so the two don't both write the
same notebook. If Orbit isn't installed, `/orbit` will point you at the release
page.

Install `uv` if you don't already have it:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Developer install (build from source)

Clone the repo and install both workspaces:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/galaxyproject/loom.git
cd loom
npm install
cd app && npm install
```

Launch Orbit:

```bash
npm start                              # from app/
```

Or use the CLI:

```bash
node bin/loom.js                       # from repo root
```

For a browser-based dev loop with hot reload (the Orbit renderer served over
the web, against the same brain), see [`web/README.md`](web/README.md).

The developer install needs Node 22.19+ (matching [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc)) and `uv` on `PATH`. Per-OS bootstrap below.

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git curl build-essential

# Node.js via nvm (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install --lts

# uv (for galaxy-mcp)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Then the developer install steps above.

#### macOS

```bash
# Homebrew, if not already installed
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

brew install node git uv
```

Then the developer install steps above.

#### Windows (WSL2)

Orbit runs on Windows inside WSL2. From an elevated PowerShell:

```powershell
wsl --install --web-download -d Ubuntu
```

Reboot, set up your Ubuntu user, then inside the Ubuntu terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/galaxyproject/loom/main/scripts/setup-wsl.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc

cd ~/loom/app && npm start
```

> **If the script fails with `Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend`**, Ubuntu's automatic updater is running in the background. Stop it first, then re-run:
>
> ```bash
> sudo systemctl stop unattended-upgrades
> curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/galaxyproject/loom/main/scripts/setup-wsl.sh | bash
> ```

Keep your analysis data inside `~/` (the Linux filesystem) — `/mnt/c/` paths are significantly slower across the filesystem boundary.

### After installation

In Orbit, on first launch, the welcome screen asks for an LLM provider + key and (optionally) a Galaxy server. You can also click **Skip — set up later** and configure things from Preferences when you're ready. You need at least one of: [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/), [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/), or [Google AI](https://aistudio.google.com/). Local providers like [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and LiteLLM work too.

In `loom`, the equivalent is editing `~/.loom/config.json` (see [Configuration](#configuration)) or running `loom --provider anthropic` and following the OAuth prompts.

## Usage

### CLI (`loom`)

```bash
loom
```

```
You: I have RNA-seq data from a drug treatment experiment — 6 samples,
     3 treated and 3 control HeLa cells. The data is at GEO accession GSE164073.

Pi:  I'll help you set up a structured analysis. Let me check what's
     available.

     [searches Galaxy IWC, finds RNA-seq DE workflow]
     [searches Galaxy tool catalog for fastp, hisat2, featureCounts, DESeq2]

     Drafting plan in chat — review before I write to notebook.md:

     ## Plan A: HeLa Drug Treatment RNA-seq DE [hybrid]

     ### Steps
     - [ ] 1. **Quality + trimming** — fastp paired collection
       - Routing: Galaxy (fastp/0.23.4)
     - [ ] 2. **Alignment** — HISAT2 to hg38 paired collection
       - Routing: Galaxy (hisat2/2.2.1)
     - [ ] 3. **featureCounts**
       - Routing: Galaxy (featurecounts/2.0.3)
     - [ ] 4. **DESeq2 differential expression**
       - Routing: Galaxy (deseq2/1.40.2)

     Approve and I'll show you the parameter table next.

You: looks good

Pi:  [shows parameter table per tool]
     [...iterates with you on min-quality, threshold...]
     [on approval: writes plan to notebook.md, begins execution]
```

Come back the next day to the same directory and everything resumes:

```
$ loom

Pi:  Loaded notebook: HeLa Drug Treatment RNA-seq DE
     Plan A is in progress (1 of 4 steps complete).

     The fastp invocation finished successfully. HISAT2 alignment is queued.
     Should I check_all to advance, or do you want to review the QC report first?
```

You can also load just the extension into Pi directly:

```bash
pi --no-extensions -e ./extensions/loom
```

If you're debugging the terminal path, prefer these commands before using Orbit.

### Orbit (Electron shell)

```bash
cd app && npm start
```

The artifact pane reveals on the first agent turn. Switch tabs with the buttons at the top of the pane:

- **Notebook** — live `notebook.md`.
- **Activity** — agent shell stream + proc-monitor.
- **File** — appears when you open a file from the left tree.

Keyboard shortcuts:

- `Cmd/Ctrl+\` — collapse / expand the artifact pane
- `Cmd/Ctrl+B` — collapse / expand the file tree
- `Cmd/Ctrl+,` — open Preferences
- `Cmd/Ctrl+O` — switch working directory and restart into a fresh agent session for that directory
- `↑` / `↓` in the chat input — recall previous prompts
- `/` — open the slash-command autocomplete
- `Esc` — dismiss modal prompts; close slash popup; cancel mid-response

## Configuration

Loom uses a single brain-level config at `~/.loom/config.json`. Every consumer (the `loom` CLI, Orbit, any future shell) reads and writes it:

```json
{
  "llm": {
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "apiKey": "sk-ant-...",
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6"
  },
  "galaxy": {
    "active": "default",
    "profiles": {
      "default": {
        "url": "https://usegalaxy.org",
        "apiKey": "abc123"
      }
    }
  },
  "skills": {
    "repos": [
      {
        "name": "galaxy-skills",
        "url": "https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-skills",
        "branch": "main",
        "enabled": true
      }
    ]
  },
  "defaultCwd": "~/analyses",
  "condaBin": "auto"
}
```

All sections are optional. If `llm` is missing, consumers fall back to environment variables or OAuth login. If `galaxy` is missing, use `/connect` to add a server interactively -- credentials save to the config automatically. Galaxy MCP registers whenever credentials are present; the agent decides per-plan whether to use Galaxy. If `skills` is missing or empty, `galaxy-skills` is lazy-seeded.

#### Galaxy credential storage

Galaxy profiles are stored in `~/.loom/config.json` under `galaxy.profiles.<name>`. The exact field depends on which shell wrote them:

- **Orbit** -- writes `apiKeyEncrypted` (base64 ciphertext from Electron `safeStorage`). The decrypted key is injected into the brain process as `GALAXY_API_KEY` at spawn time. If a brain-side `/connect` writes a plaintext `apiKey`, Orbit's config watcher re-encrypts it within milliseconds.
- **CLI** (no `safeStorage` available) -- writes `apiKey` in plaintext. The file mode is tightened to `0600`, but the key sits at rest. Acceptable for a workstation; not appropriate for shared hosts.

The brain itself never decrypts. If only `apiKeyEncrypted` is present and `GALAXY_API_KEY` isn't in the environment, the brain logs a clear warning at startup and refuses to send Galaxy requests rather than firing the wrong key.

Orbit-specific state (window geometry, pane preferences, prompt history) lives in `~/.orbit/` so multiple shells can coexist without stepping on each other.

Environment variable overrides:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
export GALAXY_URL="https://usegalaxy.org"
export GALAXY_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

Galaxy credentials can also be provided via environment variables (`GALAXY_URL`, `GALAXY_API_KEY`) for CI or testing, but `~/.loom/config.json` is the primary source.

#### Beta tester ID

If you have a tester ID, you can set it like this:

```
/tester-id orbit-007
```

Run `/tester-id` with no argument to see the current value. It writes only the `testerId` key to `~/.loom/config.json` (the rest of the file is left untouched), and Orbit attaches it to any feedback you send so reports can be traced back to your session. It can also be supplied via the `LOOM_TESTER_ID` environment variable.

### Local LLMs

Loom works with any OpenAI-compatible API -- a hosted service like [Jetstream](https://docs.jetstream-cloud.org/inference-service/overview/), or a local backend like [LiteLLM](https://litellm.ai/) or [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).

In **Orbit**, open Preferences, set the provider to **OpenAI-compatible endpoint**, enter the base URL + API key (or click the **Jetstream** preset), and pick a model. The key is stored encrypted.

For the **CLI**, add a provider entry with a `baseUrl` to `~/.loom/config.json`:

```json
{
  "llm": {
    "active": "openai-compatible",
    "providers": {
      "openai-compatible": {
        "baseUrl": "http://localhost:4000/v1",
        "model": "your-model-name",
        "apiKey": "your-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `baseUrl` marks the entry as a custom endpoint: Loom registers it with Pi for you (writing the matching `~/.pi/agent/models.json` entry, with sensible metadata defaults) and passes the key to Pi at runtime, so the key never lands in `models.json`. The provider name is yours to choose -- `"openai-compatible"` is just a convention.

## Local execution safety

Loom drives a real coding agent: alongside the Galaxy tools, the model has `bash`, `write`, `edit`, and `read` on your machine. That's the point -- local analysis needs it -- but it means a misreading model, or one that's been prompt-injected by untrusted content (a Galaxy dataset, tool output, a fetched page), could run something destructive as you. This risk is higher with cheaper, less-capable models, which Loom lets you pick to save money.

So Loom gates the model's local actions by default (the "exec-guard"):

- **Workspace jail.** Reads, writes, and edits inside your analysis directory (plus the OS temp dir) are silent; anything that resolves outside -- including via `..`, a symlink, or `~`/`$HOME` -- prompts, or is denied for weak models. So the model reads and writes freely in your project but must ask to reach anything else on disk. Writes to control locations (`.git`, `.loom/`) always prompt, even inside the workspace -- a `.git/hooks` script would run on your next commit.
- **Risk-classified `bash`.** Read-only/analysis commands (`ls`, `cat`, `grep`, ...) run without friction when they stay in the workspace. Catastrophic patterns (`rm -rf /`, `sudo`, `curl | sh`, `dd of=/dev/...`, fork bombs, ...) are always blocked -- including path-prefixed (`/usr/bin/sudo`), long-flag (`rm --recursive --force /`), wrapper-hidden (`env rm -rf ~`), explicit-home (`rm -rf $HOME`), and multi-line variants, plus any attempt to edit the gate's own config. Anything else prompts -- and any compound, redirected, or multi-line command (`;`, `&&`, `|`, `$(...)`, `>`, a newline) drops to a prompt rather than being trusted.
- **Sensitive paths.** `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `.env`, `*.pem`/`*.key`, `~/.loom/config.json`, OS keychains, and similar always prompt (or are denied for weak models) even inside the workspace -- whether the model uses `read`, `grep`, `ls`, `find`, or a `cat` in `bash`.
- **Model-tier aware.** Every model is gated. Weaker models (Haiku / GPT-4o-mini / Flash class, or unknown / local / low-cost models) get stricter defaults: a sensitive path or anything resolving outside the workspace is denied outright rather than offered for approval, and they never earn the silent auto-allow a capable model gets in a trusted workspace. An ordinary unrecognized command, though -- running a script it just wrote, or a compound/redirected command -- still drops to the *same* approval prompt a capable model would get, so scripting in explicit local mode works once you approve it. (Headless/scripted runs have no one to approve, so anything that would prompt is denied there for every tier.)
- **Fail-closed.** With no interactive session to approve (headless / scripted runs), anything that would prompt is denied. A one-time consent notice is shown on the first gated action, and every decision is recorded in `activity.jsonl`.

When a command needs approval you can allow it once, allow it for the session, or trust the workspace (which stops prompting for routine commands there).

### Bypassing the gate

If you fully control the environment and want the agent to run unattended (CI, a trusted pipeline, your own box), you can turn the gate off:

- **Config:** set `"guardian": { "dangerouslyBypassPermissions": true }` in `~/.loom/config.json`.
- **CLI:** `loom --dangerously-bypass-permissions` (one invocation; does not persist). `--safe` (or `LOOM_SAFE=1`) forces the gate back on and wins over everything.
- **Orbit:** Preferences -> Safety -> "Dangerously bypass permissions" (a native confirm appears first; a red banner stays up while it's active).

Bypass is total -- it removes all prompts and the workspace jail. It can only be enabled by a human through one of those channels: the agent can't turn it on itself, because writing `~/.loom/config.json` is blocked whether it uses the file tools or `bash`, and Orbit's toggle requires an OS-level confirmation the renderer can't forge. The default (`guardian.enabled: true`, not bypassed) is secure; relaxing it is always an explicit choice.

### What the write-jail actually confines -- and what it doesn't

To be precise about the boundary: the workspace jail (default-on, every platform) confines the AI's file writes via the `write` and `edit` tools. Those tools can create or modify files inside your analysis directory (where `notebook.md` lives), plus the OS temp dir and Loom's own `.loom` state; writing anywhere else, or to a credential-shaped path (private keys like `id_rsa`/`id_ed25519`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `.env`, and `ssh`/`aws`/`gcloud`/`kube`/`docker`/keychain dirs), prompts for approval.

Shell (`bash`) commands are **not** OS-sandboxed by default -- they're gated per action by the same approval flow (catastrophic patterns blocked outright, everything else prompts), but a bash command that writes a file or touches the network doesn't go through the write-jail path. To also confine bash writes and limit its network access inside a real OS sandbox, enable the opt-in bash sandbox (`--sandbox` / `LOOM_SANDBOX=1` / `guardian.sandbox`), available on macOS and Linux/WSL2.

What this does **not** confine: reading files (the write-jail is not an exfiltration control), and data leaving via remote channels -- syncing the notebook to a Galaxy Page, Galaxy MCP operations (uploads, running tools), `skills_fetch`'s cache writes under `~/.loom`, or web fetches. Treat the working-dir confinement as "the AI's edits stay in your analysis directory," not "your data cannot leave the machine."

## Cost tracking

Orbit's footer shows live in-flight cost for the active session (computed from `usage.cost` returned per stream event by pi-ai). For accurate **historical / per-project / per-model** reporting across all your sessions, run [CodeBurn](https://github.com/getagentseal/codeburn) in a separate terminal:

```bash
npx codeburn          # interactive TUI dashboard
npx codeburn today    # today's spend
npx codeburn month    # this month
npx codeburn status   # one-liner: today + month totals
```

CodeBurn auto-detects Loom/Pi sessions under `~/.pi/agent/sessions/` (Pi is a first-class supported provider — no configuration needed) and pulls model pricing from LiteLLM's catalog, so newly-released models work without a Loom update. Each Loom project (= cwd) shows up as a separate row, so you can see what each analysis cost. CSV / JSON export is built in.

## Tool reference

Loom registers a small set of extension tools. Plans, decisions, results, and interpretation all live as markdown sections in `notebook.md` — the agent maintains them via the standard `Edit`/`Write` tools.

| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GTN tutorials**              | `gtn_search`, `gtn_fetch`                                                                |
| **Galaxy invocations**         | `galaxy_invocation_record`, `galaxy_invocation_check_all`, `galaxy_invocation_check_one` |
| **Skills**                     | `skills_fetch` (fetch SKILL.md / reference docs from configured repos)                   |
| **Multi-agent (experimental)** | `team_dispatch` (gated by `LOOM_TEAM_DISPATCH=1`)                                        |

Galaxy MCP (registered separately when credentials are present) provides `galaxy_connect`, `galaxy_search_tools_by_name`, `galaxy_run_tool`, `galaxy_invoke_workflow`, `galaxy_search_iwc`, `get_iwc_workflows`, `import_workflow_from_iwc`, user-defined tool lifecycle (`galaxy_create_user_tool`, `galaxy_list_user_tools`, `galaxy_run_user_tool`, `galaxy_delete_user_tool`), history/dataset operations, and more.

## Terminal-only validation

For non-Electron validation:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
pi --no-extensions -e ./extensions/loom
```

Then validate the wrapper in a plain working directory:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/loom-cli-validation
cd /tmp/loom-cli-validation
node /path/to/loom/bin/loom.js --provider anthropic --model claude-sonnet-4-6
```
