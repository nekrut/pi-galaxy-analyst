/**
 * Issue #320 (angle 2): asked to "save the chat history to a file", the agent
 * streamed a confident "...saved as chat_history.md" and then the turn ended on
 * an opaque provider error -- with no file written. Two behaviors need steering:
 * (1) never claim a save that a write tool didn't actually perform, and
 * (2) reproducing a whole transcript verbatim is itself a recitation-stop
 * trigger, so route the user to the real export affordance / prefer a summary.
 *
 * These are regression guards: prompt content can't assert model *behavior*,
 * but they fail loudly if the steer is silently dropped or reworded away from
 * its load-bearing phrases. Matching is whitespace-normalized so a benign
 * reflow of the prose doesn't break them.
